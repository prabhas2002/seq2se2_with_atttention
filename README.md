# seq2se2_with_atttention
This project is an implementation of Seq2Seq model where Encoder and decoder are both RNN incorporated with Attention.

The dataset I have considered for this is as follows:

## Input:
multiple date formats like 12 dec 1976, March 15 2002 , 2004 17 April.....

## Output:
Machine readable format --  ( 12/12/1976) [standard format]


## Results:
I got around 96 percent accuracy on the validation dataset.
